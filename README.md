## 1. PROJECT ABSTRACT
Pixelate Studios, a game development company, is facing performance issues with their asset management system. During gameplay, their Python-based asset loader frequently causes lag spikes due to inefficient memory usage. The development team suspects memory leaks, excessive garbage collection pauses, and inefficient object lifecycle management. You've been tasked with creating a demonstration that explores Python's memory management mechanisms and develops strategies to optimize memory usage in their asset loading system. This assignment will help you understand Python's memory model, reference counting, garbage collection, and memory optimization techniques.

## 2. BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
1. Demonstrate Python's memory allocation and deallocation mechanisms
2. Analyze memory usage patterns for different data structures
3. Identify and resolve memory leaks caused by circular references
4. Implement memory profiling to track object creation and destruction
5. Optimize memory usage through proper object lifecycle management
6. Document best practices for memory-efficient Python programming

## 3. CODE STRUCTURE
1. Memory Analysis Functions:
   - `track_objects_count()` - Tracks objects before and after garbage collection
   - `object_size(obj)` - Measures the memory footprint of an object
   - `demonstrate_reference_counting()` - Shows Python's reference counting in action

2. Memory Leak Demonstrations:
   - `create_circular_reference()` - Demonstrates memory leaks through circular references
   - `fix_circular_reference()` - Shows how to prevent memory leaks using weak references

3. Memory Optimization Techniques:
   - `compare_data_structures()` - Compares memory usage of different data structures
   - `demonstrate_generator_vs_list()` - Shows memory benefits of generators over lists
   - `ObjectPool` class - Implements object pooling for reusing objects

4. Main Program:
   - Demonstrates different memory management concepts
   - Compares memory-efficient vs. inefficient implementations

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
1. Reference Counting Implementation:
   - Create classes with `__del__` method to observe object destruction
   - Demonstrate how multiple references affect object lifecycle
   - Example:
   ```python
   def demonstrate_reference_counting():
       class CountedObject:
           def __init__(self, name):
               self.name = name
               print(f"Object '{name}' created")
               
           def __del__(self):
               print(f"Object '{self.name}' destroyed")
       
       # Create object with one reference
       obj = CountedObject("test")
       # Create second reference
       obj2 = obj
       # Remove first reference
       del obj
       # Object still exists due to second reference
       # Remove second reference
       del obj2
       # Now the object is destroyed
   ```

2. Circular Reference Implementation:
   - Create objects that reference each other in a cycle
   - Show how this prevents garbage collection
   - Demonstrate solutions using weak references
   - Example:
   ```python
   def create_circular_reference():
       class Node:
           def __init__(self, name):
               self.name = name
               self.neighbors = []
               print(f"Node '{name}' created")
               
           def __del__(self):
               print(f"Node '{self.name}' destroyed")
       
       # Create nodes
       nodes = [Node(f"Node-{i}") for i in range(3)]
       
       # Create circular references
       for i in range(3):
           nodes[i].neighbors.append(nodes[(i+1) % 3])
       
       # Lose external references
       del nodes
       gc.collect()
       # Objects with circular references won't be collected!
   ```

3. Memory Optimization Implementation:
   - Compare memory usage of different data structures
   - Demonstrate lazy evaluation with generators
   - Implement object pooling for reusing objects
   - Example:
   ```python
   class ObjectPool:
       def __init__(self, factory_func, max_size=10):
           self.factory_func = factory_func
           self.max_size = max_size
           self.pool = []
           
       def get(self):
           if self.pool:
               return self.pool.pop()
           return self.factory_func()
           
       def release(self, obj):
           if len(self.pool) < self.max_size:
               self.pool.append(obj)
   ```

## 5. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
The implementation should use only standard library modules:
1. `gc` - For interacting with Python's garbage collector
2. `sys` - For measuring object sizes
3. `time` - For basic performance measurements
4. `weakref` - For implementing weak references

No third-party libraries or external dependencies are needed.

## 5. EXECUTION STEPS
1. Run the memory profiling functions with different data structures
2. Observe memory usage patterns with and without circular references
3. Compare memory consumption between naive and optimized implementations
4. Analyze garbage collection behavior with different object types
5. Identify and fix memory leaks in the demonstration code
6. Document memory usage best practices based on observations

## 6. EXPECTED OUTCOMES
1. Reference counting demonstration:
   - Students should observe object creation and destruction as references are added and removed
   - Object should only be destroyed when the last reference is removed

2. Circular reference demonstration:
   - Objects with circular references should not be garbage collected
   - The same objects using weak references should be properly garbage collected

3. Memory optimization results:
   - Generators should use significantly less memory than equivalent lists
   - Object pooling should show performance improvements over creating/destroying objects
   - Different data structures should show varying memory efficiency for the same data

4. General understanding:
   - Students should gain insights into Python's memory management mechanisms
   - Students should learn practical techniques to identify and avoid memory leaks
   - Students should understand memory-efficient programming patterns
